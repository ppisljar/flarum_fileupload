# flarum_fileupload

fileupload extension for flarum [work in progress]

adds upload button to composer, after clicking it you can select the file you want to upload. file url is appended to composer editor after succesfull upload.

TODO:
- move button to more appropriate place (waiting till visual buttons are added to flarum core)
- loading indication
- add settings to backend (allowed file type / file size / folder )

- add s9e/TextFormatter parser, which will look for allowed file types and replace them with [image (based on filetype) + link]
